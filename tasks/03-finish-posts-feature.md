# Task 05: Finish /Posts Feature

## Context
**App:** Jordnaer (.NET Blazor Server)  
**Area:** Posts  
**Priority:** High

## Objective
Complete the implementation of the /Posts page/feature to make it fully functional.

## Current State
The /Posts feature is incomplete and needs additional functionality to be production-ready.

## Requirements
1. Identify missing functionality in /Posts
2. Implement remaining features (e.g., filtering, sorting, pagination)
3. Ensure posts display correctly with markdown rendering
4. Add appropriate user interactions (like, comment, share if applicable)
5. Ensure the create post form looks great

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All missing functionality identified and documented
- [ ] Filtering implemented (by category, date, author, etc.)
- [ ] Sorting options available (newest, popular, etc.)
- [ ] Pagination working correctly
- [ ] Markdown rendering displays properly
- [ ] User interactions functional (based on requirements)
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large numbers of posts
- [ ] Mobile and desktop layouts work well

## Approach Suggestions
1. First audit the current /Posts implementation
2. List missing features
3. Implement features incrementally
4. Test with realistic data volumes

## Files to Investigate
- `/Posts` page component
- Post-related components (likely in `Features/GroupPosts/` or similar)
- `GroupPostList.razor` (currently open in editor)
