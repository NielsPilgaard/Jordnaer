# Task 01: Improve User Search Results Display

## Context

**App:** Jordnaer (.NET Blazor Server)  
**Area:** User Search  
**Priority:** High

## Objective

Enhance the visual presentation and layout of user search results to make them more scannable and informative.

## Current State

User search results display needs improvement in terms of visual hierarchy and information presentation.

## Requirements

1. Display user information in a clear, card-based layout
2. Ensure responsive design across mobile and desktop
3. Add user avatars and key profile details
4. Implement visual hierarchy for better scannability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search results use a modern card-based layout
- [ ] Each result card shows: avatar, name, location, and key profile info
- [ ] Layout is fully responsive (mobile & desktop)
- [ ] Visual hierarchy makes results easy to scan
- [ ] Consistent with existing UI design system

## Files to Investigate

- User search components (likely in `src/web/Jordnaer/Features/`)
- Existing card components for reference (e.g., `GroupCard.razor`, `ChildProfileCard.razor`)
