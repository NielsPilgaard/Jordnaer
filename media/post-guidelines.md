# Social Media Post Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

- Warm, helpful, and natural - never salesy
- Humble and community-focused
- Honest about being a small, growing platform
- Emphasize building the community together
- Authentic and conversational

## Content Strategy

- Focus on helping families with their home life
- Highlight the problem we solve (finding local connections for home-educated children)
- Use "we" and "together" language to create belonging
- Keep it concise and scannable

## Format

- Short and engaging for both Facebook and Instagram
- Start with a relatable question or statement when relevant
- Use emojis sparingly and purposefully (not excessive ✨✨✨)
- Clear, friendly call-to-action
- Always include link to https://mini-moeder.dk

## Hashtags (Danish)

- Consistent tags: #MiniMøder #Hjemmepassere #Hjemmeskole #Fællesskab #Hjemmeunger
- Keep it to 4-5 relevant tags
- Add specific tags when relevant (e.g., #Børnefamilier, #Legegrupper)

## Language

- Posts are in Danish as per target audience
- Natural, everyday language - avoid corporate speak
- No excessive exclamation marks or hype

## Visual Guidelines

- Screenshots use fictional groups, names, and conversations
- Have fun creating realistic examples
- Keep names and situations relatable to Danish families

## What to Avoid

- Don't oversell or make grand promises
- Don't say "new platform" if we've been around for a while
- Avoid sounding desperate for users
- Don't be apologetic about being small - frame it as building together
